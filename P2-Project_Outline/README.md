## Submission Instructions

Our application is designed to assist people in optimizing their planting efforts. With our app, users can input important information like seed names, hardiness zones, planting dates, and desired watering schedules. Additionally, users can create waterbeds and add existing seeds to them. The app provides a list of created seeds and garden beds for easy tracking.
Our goal is to help users stay accountable to their watering schedules. To achieve this, we plan to utilize APIs to determine hardiness zones and watering schedules. We also aim to experiment with various reminder options, such as a calendar or automated emails.
